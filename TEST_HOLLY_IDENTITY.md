## How to Test:

1. Wait for Railway deployment to complete (check https://hollyhotbox.com)
2. Log in to Holly Hot Box
3. Open a chat session
4. Ask each test question one at a time
5. Verify Holly's responses match the expected behavior

## What Was Changed:

1. **Added System Context** in `views.py` that tells Holly:
   - Her name is "Holly"
   - She has Google Sheets integration capabilities
   - She CAN create and manage Google Sheets
   - She should respond with JSON action requests when asked to create sheets

2. **Added Action Detection** in `views.py` that:
   - Detects when Holly wants to create a Google Sheet
   - Calls the Google Sheets API
   - Returns the spreadsheet URL to the user

3. **Result:** Holly should now recognize her identity and capabilities, and actively offer to create Google Sheets when asked.
